# Introduction

This GitHub Repository consists of the code and additional information like datasets and trained models used in the paper titled, "A Rapid-Raman Spectroscopy and Machine Learning Based Approach for *S. aureus* Detection in Milk." This study aims to create a rapid, easy-to-use, cost-effective and scalable pipeline for milk quality control applications. This particular project aims to demonstrate a proof-of-concept for the pipeline, and future projects with a larger dataset can expand on this project and increase both accuracy and use cases for the application. 

All required libraries for using the code are in the requirements.txt file and details about the methods are in the paper. Analysis and the model training steps can be found on the respective branches.
