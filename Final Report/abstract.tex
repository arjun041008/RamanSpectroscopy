This study proposes a novel pipeline for rapidly detecting \textit{S. aureus} in milk samples using Raman spectroscopy and machine learning. In utilizing a two-pronged approach for optimizing accuracy using Principal Component Analysis and ensuring maximum interpretability using Shapely Activated exPlanations (SHAP) analysis. Most of the models achieved above 90\% AUROC, demonstrating proof of concept using the smaller 55 spectra dataset obtained. This pipeline for quality control offers a rapid, 10-minute, cost-effective, and scalable method that can be implemented in dairy processing centers with further study.
